[Sherlock Score](https://www.sherlockscore.com/ "Sherlock Score's Homepage") integration for Laravel.

Track your users, trials, and paid accounts with Sherlockâ€™s Product Engagement Scoring engine.

## Installation

Via Composer

```php
$ composer require iugosds/sherlaravel
```

## Usage

First of all, add a SHERLOCK_SCORE_API_KEY key to your .env file:
```php
SHERLOCK_SCORE_API_KEY=a12b34c56...
```

You can also disable this package by adding a SHERLOCK_SCORE_ENABLED key set to false (true by default).

To start interacting with Sherlock Score, use the following methods:

```php
use SherLaravel;
```

```php
SherLaravel::identifyAccount("groupIdHere");
```
With Sherlock you can keep track of Accounts (or groups of users). To identfy a new account, add the line above to your controller.

```php
SherLaravel::identifyUser("userIdHere");
```
The identifyUser method is used to identify a new User. It will be tipically added to the register method on your login controller, or to the "created" event of your User Model in case you are using Observers.

```php
SherLaravel::trackEvent("userID", "event-name");
```
In your controllers, use the trackEvent method every time you want to track an interaction with a user.


```php
SherLaravel::identifyAccount(String $group_id, ?Array $traits= [], ?int $timestamp = null)
SherLaravel::identifyUser(String $user_id, ?String $group_id = null, ?Array $traits= [], ?int $timestamp = null)
SherLaravel::trackEvent(String $user_id, String $event, ?int $timestamp = null)
```

##Sample:
```php
SherLaravel::identifyUser("1234", "Customer44", [
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'johndoe@example.com'],
    '1553647710707');
```
